This Java project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism. 
It includes an extended Animal hierarchy with Dog, Cat, and Bird classes, where the Bird class adds a unique fly() behavior.

 FEATURES:
- Inheritance using `extends`
- Method overriding with `@Override`
- Bird class with `fly()` method
- Polymorphism demonstration in `Main.java`
